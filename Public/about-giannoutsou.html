    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Panagiota Giannoutsou. I was born and raised in Greece. I currenty work as an analytical chemist, but friends, hear this; I WANT TO ESCAPE. I am currently 29 years old and I want to enter the bubble of Web development. I am obviously having a work-oriented-full-blown-crisis.</p>
    <p>Oh well, I could have filled this "About" page with a Lorem Ipsum text, but firstly, I think it is strange that we use such an intelectual text that someone much smarter (at least than me) wrote, simply as filler, and secondly, I hope that years from now, when I will be a working web developper sleeping with plush toys and living the life, I will be able to look back upon this text and laugh. With pride and arrogance!</p>
    <p>I really hope no-one reads this. I f you did, know that I am not even sorry and that my task is probably doomed. Bye-bye now.</p>
