<h1>Very cool movies (According to moi of course) </h1>
<h2>Get ready for Top-five baby!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>5. Pride and prejudice</h3>
<p>The Keira Knightley version. Duh. Romance, witty dialog and Mr. Darcy.</p>
<h3>4. The best offer</h3>
<p>Mystery, art, some mysterious ancient robot and romance (?). I have suggested this movie to many a friends, and it never loses!</p>
<h3>3. Whatever happened to baby Jane?</h3>
<p>Ah, classical Hollywood. Betty Davis and Joan Crawford. I shouldn't have to say any more. Enjoy, thank me later.</p>
<h3>2. Get out!</h3>
<p>I love thriller/horror movies. I mean, who doesn't? This one is particulary good, let me tell you. More of a thriller though, sprinkled with some well entwined commentary about racism. Five stars from me!</p>
<h3>1. Inception</h3>
<p>Watched this one twice in cinemas. Never regretted it. Would 100% do it again.</p>
